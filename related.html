<h3>Reports on CMS</h3>

<p>CMS has used in many national and international contests. Some
contest organizers wrote detailed reports on their experience with
CMS, which may be useful for other contest hosts using or considering
to use CMS. In particular, many of them discuss the problems to
address in order to use CMS with several hundreds of users.</p>
