CMS, or Contest Management System, is a distributed system for running and (to
some extent) organizing a programming contest.

CMS has been designed to be general and to handle many different types of
contests, tasks, scorings, etc. Nonetheless, CMS has been explicitly build to be
used in the 2012 International Olympiad in Informatics, held in September 2012
in Italy.
