CMS has been used in several official and unofficial contests. In particular we
are aware of the following.

## International competitions

- [International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://ioinformatics.org/)

    The IOI is an annual competitive programming competition and one of the
    International Science Olympiads for secondary school students. The first
    edition was held in 1989 in Pravetz, Bulgaria.
    
    Before IOI 1994, a human evaluator would sit behind the competitor's
    computer and do the testing manually (enter test data through the keyboard,
    check the output on the screen).

    Starting in IOI 1994, an automatic grading process has been used, with test
    input defined in files. We don't know much about the systems used in these
    early IOI editions.
    
    CMS was explicitly designed to be used in IOI 2012 and has been used
    every year since, including in IOI 2024, with the only exception of IOI 2016
    where the local host (Russia) opted for a different system.

If you used CMS for a contest, selection, or a similar event, and want to
publicize this information, we would be more than happy to hear from you and add
it to this list.
