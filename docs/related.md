## Reports on CMS

CMS has used in many national and international contests. Some contest
organizers wrote detailed reports on their experience with CMS, which may be
useful for other contest hosts using or considering to use CMS. In particular,
many of them discuss the problems to address in order to use CMS with several
hundreds of users.
